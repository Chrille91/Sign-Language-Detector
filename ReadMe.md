## Idea
We want to support people who use sign language as their main source of communication. 

## Scope 
Although there are already AI projects exploring this direction, the idea of the project is to expand on the current issues existing AI projects are facing in the attempt to provide a smoother communication between people with hearing loss and those who have no knowledge of sign language. 

## Further Thoughts
### Potential Hurdles
some signs incorporate movements, i.e. training on videos necessary

### Bonus Goal 1
Translation of national sign languages using subtitles

### Bonus Goal 2
Translating speech to hand signs.

### Stretch Goals
speech-captioning, lip reading, body language detection,...
